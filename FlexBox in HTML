- New way to arrange items into rows or columns

flex container:
- elemenet has the display: flex on it

flex shorthand:
- flex declaration is a shorthand for;
  flex-grow
  flex-shrink
  flex-basis

Example: Below equates to flex-grow: 1, flex-shrink: 1, flex-basis: 0
  div {
    flex: 1;
}

- When flex: 1 is applied, every div grows the same amount. 
If flex: 2 is added, that the div would gow to 2x the size of the others
