Specifity:
- CSS declarations that are more specific will take precedence over less specific ones. Inline styles take precedence over selectors:
  - ID Selectors (most specific selector)
  - Class Selectors
  - Type Selectors

Inheritance:
- Refers to certain CSS properties that are inherited by that element's descendants. 

Rule Order:
- Whichever rule was the last defined is the winner
